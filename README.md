### Development Setup

First, [install Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#install-flask) if you haven't already.

  ```
  $ cd ~
  $ sudo pip3 install Flask *** if your machine has only python3 you could do pip install Flask instead
  ```

To start and run the local development server,

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:
  ```
  $ cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PATH/
  $ python -m venv -env *** to create a virtual environment for--site-packages
  $ . env/Scripts/activate  *** to activate the virtual environment for packages installation
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:
  ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run the development server:
  ```
  $ export FLASK_APP=myapp
  $ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
  $ python3 app.py *** if your machine has only python3 you could do python app.py instead
  ```

4. Navigate to Home page [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
